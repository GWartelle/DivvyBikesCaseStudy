# DivvyBikesCaseStudy

## Case Study Presentation

This is a case study focusing on the DivvyBikes rental service. I am conducting this analysis to apply the skills I acquired through the Google Data Analytics Certificate program hosted on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-data-analytics). The main objective of this study is to identify differences between members and casual users and propose strategies to boost subscription rates for Divvy services.

## Analysis Summary

Based on this analysis, here are the differences between members and casual users:

  - **Members:** Likely local residents or students, prefer efficient commuting, shorter rides, and downtown/university stations.
  - **Casual Users:** Likely tourists, prefer leisurely exploration, with more spread-out station usage and longer trip durations.

To increase conversion rate, I propose these measures:

  - Introducing promotional pricing around holiday seasons, or special events.
  - Creating short-term subscription plans, such as a weekly or weekend subscription.
  - Expanding station networks in tourist-heavy areas.
  - Promoting Divvy services in these same areas.
